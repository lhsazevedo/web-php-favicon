# PHP favicon

This is the Inkscape project file for my PHP favicon.

## Export steps

### PNG images
- Export a 196x196px PNG image.
- Use an image editor to scale it down to 16x16, 32x32 variantes. Ensure the 16x16 result is crispy. I've used GIMP.
- Use TinyPNG or similar to optimize the PNG images.

### ICO icon
Use https://redketchup.io/icon-editor or a similar editor to create a single .ICO icon with both 16x16 and 32x32 dimensions using the respective PNGs exported before.

### SVG Icon
- Export a optimized SVG from Inkscape.
- Use an SVG optimizer like SVGOMG to optimize it.

## Why not use an online favicon generator
I tried [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) but the 16x16 version was not as crispy as scaling down using GIMP.
It has options for the scaling algorithm though.
